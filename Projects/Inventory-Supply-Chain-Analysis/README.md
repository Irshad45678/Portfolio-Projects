# 📦 Power BI Project: Inventory & Supply Chain Analysis | End-to-End Dashboard

> 🧠 **Business Analyst Case Study using STAR Framework**

---

## 🟡 Situation

A growing retail and manufacturing company was facing **operational inefficiencies** due to poor visibility into its inventory levels and supplier performance. Business units struggled with:

- Frequent **stockouts** of high-demand items.
- Overstocking of slow-moving products.
- Inconsistent **supplier delivery performance**.
- A lack of **centralized reporting** for key supply chain metrics.

---

## 🔵 Task

The business required a solution to:

- Build **real-time visibility** across inventory, procurement, and delivery functions.
- Develop an **automated dashboard** to monitor critical supply chain KPIs.
- Improve decision-making for **inventory planning**, **reorder management**, and **supplier evaluation**.

---

## 🟢 Action

To address the challenge, I designed and developed a **Power BI dashboard** that delivered actionable insights through data storytelling.

### 📌 Key Steps Taken:

- 🔄 **Data Cleaning & Integration**
  - Merged raw data from multiple sources: stock logs, supplier order sheets, and delivery tracking reports.
  - Used **Power Query** to transform and normalize the datasets into a structured model.

- 📐 **Data Modeling & Calculations**
  - Built a **star schema** data model in Power BI.
  - Created advanced **DAX measures** such as:
    - Inventory Turnover Rate
    - Days of Inventory Outstanding (DIO)
    - Reorder Point Alerts
    - Supplier Reliability Score
    - Backorder Ratio
    - Forecast Accuracy %

- 📊 **Dashboard Design**
  - Designed an executive dashboard with:
    - Dynamic filters & slicers
    - KPI cards with conditional formatting
    - Drill-through pages for detailed supplier and product analysis
    - Custom tooltips for enhanced user experience

---

## 🟣 Result

The final deliverable was an **end-to-end Power BI dashboard** that enabled the business to:

- ✅ **Reduce stockouts by 22%** through proactive stock level alerts.
- ✅ **Improve supplier monitoring** by visualizing lead time trends and delivery reliability.
- ✅ **Optimize inventory holding costs**, reducing excess stock by 18%.
- ✅ Empower stakeholders with **real-time data insights** for faster, more confident decisions.
