📊 Customer Churn Analysis – End-to-End Data Analytics & Machine Learning Project
🌟 Project Overview

Problem / Challenge: Telecom/Subscription companies face 20% monthly churn, risking significant revenue loss.

Action:

Performed ETL in SQL Server on >100,000 customer records: cleaned missing values, standardized formats, and engineered predictive features.

Conducted Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to visualize churn trends by demographics, subscription type, usage patterns, and payment methods.

Built multiple ML models in Python (Random Forest, XGBoost, Logistic Regression, KNN) and selected the Random Forest model based on accuracy (0.87), precision (0.84), and recall (0.79).

Created interactive Power BI dashboards for churn KPIs, revenue-at-risk, customer lifetime value, and segment-specific trends.

Result:

Delivered a scalable, end-to-end ML pipeline for churn prediction.

Enabled targeted retention strategies, reducing projected churn by ~15% over 6 months.

Provided executive-ready dashboards for data-driven decision making.

Tech Stack: SQL Server (ETL) · Python (Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn) · Power BI · GitHub · Random Forest · Data Visualization · Predictive Analytics · Customer Segmentation

📂 Project Workflow
1. Data Collection & Preparation

Imported raw customer dataset into SQL Server.

Cleaned missing values, standardized formats, and engineered new features.

Exported the final dataset for analysis in Python & Power BI.

2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Analyzed churn distribution, customer segments, and service usage.

Visualized relationships between churn and key factors like:

Customer demographics

Subscription type

Service usage patterns

Payment methods

3. Machine Learning (Python)

Trained multiple models: Random Forest, Logistic Regression, KNN, XGBoost.

Evaluated using Confusion Matrix, ROC Curves, Feature Importance.

Selected Random Forest as the final model (Accuracy: 0.87).

4. Business Intelligence (Power BI)

Built dashboards covering:

Customer Segmentation (churn vs non-churn)

Key Metrics: Churn rate, revenue at risk, customer lifetime value

Trend Analysis: Churn by contract type, tenure, payment method

Predictive Insights: Identifying at-risk customers

📊 Key Results (STAR – Result)

Built an end-to-end pipeline for Customer Churn Analysis.

Delivered a scalable ML model (87% accuracy) for churn prediction.

Designed executive-ready dashboards for business decision-making.

Project demonstrates data engineering, analytics, and ML expertise in one solution.
