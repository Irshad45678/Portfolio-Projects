📊 Customer Churn Analysis – End-to-End Data Analytics & Machine Learning Project
🌟 Project Overview

This project demonstrates an end-to-end Customer Churn Analysis pipeline integrating SQL Server (ETL), Power BI (Visualization), and Python (Machine Learning with Random Forest).
The goal is to identify customers at risk of churning and provide data-driven insights for retention strategies.

The project applies the STAR methodology:

Situation: Telecom/Subscription companies face high churn rates, leading to revenue loss.

Task: Build a system to analyze churn, identify patterns, and predict customers likely to leave.

Action:

Performed ETL in SQL Server to clean & prepare raw customer data.

Built interactive Power BI dashboards to visualize churn KPIs, customer segments, and trends.

Developed a Random Forest ML model in Python with scikit-learn to predict churn.

Result: Achieved 87% prediction accuracy, empowering businesses to design proactive retention strategies and reduce churn.

🛠️ Tech Stack & Tools

SQL Server (SSMS): Data Extraction, Transformation & Loading (ETL)

Power BI: Interactive dashboards & business insights

Python (pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn): ML Model Development

📂 Project Workflow
1. Data Collection & Preparation

Imported raw customer dataset into SQL Server.

Cleaned missing values, standardized formats, and engineered new features.

Exported the final dataset for analysis in Python & Power BI.

2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Analyzed churn distribution, customer segments, and service usage.

Visualized relationships between churn and key factors like:

Customer demographics

Subscription type

Service usage patterns

Payment methods

3. Machine Learning (Python)

Trained multiple models: Random Forest, Logistic Regression, KNN, XGBoost.

Evaluated using Confusion Matrix, ROC Curves, Feature Importance.

Selected Random Forest as the final model (Accuracy: 0.87).

4. Business Intelligence (Power BI)

Built dashboards covering:

Customer Segmentation (churn vs non-churn)

Key Metrics: Churn rate, revenue at risk, customer lifetime value

Trend Analysis: Churn by contract type, tenure, payment method

Predictive Insights: Identifying at-risk customers

📊 Key Results (STAR – Result)

Built an end-to-end pipeline for Customer Churn Analysis.

Delivered a scalable ML model (87% accuracy) for churn prediction.

Designed executive-ready dashboards for business decision-making.

Project demonstrates data engineering, analytics, and ML expertise in one solution.
