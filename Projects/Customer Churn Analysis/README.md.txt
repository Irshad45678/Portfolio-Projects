📊 Customer Churn Analysis
🔍 Overview

This project analyzes customer churn behavior and builds a predictive model to identify customers likely to leave. The pipeline integrates SQL (ETL), Power BI (dashboards), and Python (Machine Learning) to deliver data-driven insights for customer retention.

🎯 Objectives

Understand factors influencing customer churn.

Perform ETL in SQL Server for data cleaning and transformation.

Build Power BI dashboards for interactive reporting.

Train and evaluate a Random Forest Classifier to predict churn.

Achieved 87% prediction accuracy.

🛠️ Tools & Technologies

SQL Server → ETL, Data Preparation

Power BI → Interactive Dashboards & KPIs

Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn) → ML Modeling & Analysis

Random Forest Classifier → Best performing model


📊 Key Insights

Customers with month-to-month contracts are more likely to churn.

High monthly charges significantly correlate with churn.

Tenure plays a strong role in customer retention.
